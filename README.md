### N.E.S.O.L.I.N.E
Neural Emotional Support & Online Listening Intelligence Network Entity

N.E.S.O.L.I.N.E is an open-source AI companion that runs fully offline using local language models powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. It is designed as a privacy-first desk companion that not only assists with simple tasks like updating and uploading code, but also provides conversational support, emotional continuity, and presence.

N.E.S.O.L.I.N.E is not meant to replace human connection.
It exists to reduce silence when no one else is there, to offer comfort, all while helping you.

## Core features
- fully localized, offline language model execution
- runs on raspberry pi (8Gb recommended)
- Privacy First, No cloud models, or server sharing.
- conversational continuty with memory
- developer assistant (git, code and project summaries, explantions)
- voice input and speech output
- physical presence, through leds, motions, displaying expressions




 ## Roadmap
  - phase 1: local conversation 
  - phase 2: persistent memory system 
  - phase 3: voice integration 
  - phase 4: physical shell, and any other designs
  - phase 5: adaptive emotional modeling through design. (Ex: blinking when thinking, no bliniking when listening, facial expressions through light)




## Vision
- to make it very simple, upload N.E.S.O.L.I.N.E into a usb and plug and play into a pi kit
- modular hardware kit
- open hardware documentation
- community, tailored personally made moduels
- assistive mode for elderly and those that aren't as knowledgeable
